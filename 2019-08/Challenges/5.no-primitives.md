###Rule
Aka “No Naked Primitives”
- All primitive values (e.g. booleans, numbers or strings) need to be wrapped and must not be visible at object boundaries.
- Arrays, all kinds of containers like lists or hash-tables and even Object (the root class of the language’s class hierarchy) are considered primitive as well.
