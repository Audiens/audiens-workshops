## Rule

Peer programming with more than 2 people 

## Round Robin
Randomly assign a driver (maybe someone who knows, how to setup an empty project) and let the keyboard cycle around the group. You could either set a timer or just pass on after each TDD cycle. If the navigators are talking “against each other”, you might consider to reduce to a single navigator (e.g. always the person to the right of the keyboard.

## Designated Driver
Have a designated driver for the whole session. The driver is not allowed to drive on its own, just follow the instructions of the navigators. This is definitely not a fair distribution between the roles, but an experienced coder who knows its way through the IDE can really enable a small team to do some rapid prototyping. (And maybe the driver may ask a question from time to time.)
