# Pattern: Facade

## Feature 

*A complex business logic need to be implemented*

### What Facade is
Facade is a pattern which aims to hide the complexity of an algorithm and its dependencies.

**Pros:**

- Lower dependencies in the client (loose coupling)
- Better reading of the client's logic
- In case of "builders" it may be reused in other parts of the code (i.e. user registration, different channels)

**Cons:**

- Little knowledge of what's going on
- May generate unpredictable behaviours

### To add:
 - Add a call to the main method with the following parameters `+,5,5,5` 
 - Add a call to the main method with the following parameters `*,4,6,7`
 - Add a call to the main method with the following parameters `?,95,45,63`
 - Add a call to the main method with the following parameters `?,1,2,3`
